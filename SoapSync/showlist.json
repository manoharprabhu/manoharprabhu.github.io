He teams up with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, who is a meth dealer. Jesse tries to sell the meth they made, but the dealers snatch him and make him show them their lab, which is in an old RV.

When Walt wakes up, he tells Krazy-8 that he has lung cancer and they start talking about unexpected things they have in common. Eventually, Walt decides to release Krazy-8 but, while disposing of the shards of a broken plate, he sees that a shard is missing and realizes Krazy-8 has concealed it to use as a weapon against him. Feigning his release, Walt confronts Krazy-8 with this information and is immediately attacked; he subsequently garrottes his prisoner in self-defense."

When the initial batch of meth only yields $2,600, Walt demands that Jesse find a new distributor to fund his medical expenses. Jesse gets connected to Tuco, the drug dealer who replaced Krazy-8.

Walt and Jesse use thermite to break into a warehouse, where they steal a large barrel of methylamine. Methylamine is necessary for a new recipe that can produce much more meth in a shorter period of time, without the need to procure large quantities of pseudoephedrine. They deliver the promised amount of meth to Tuco, but during the transaction, one of Tuco's associates makes a seemingly innocuous comment, prompting Tuco to savagely beat him."
